brackets-reverse
================

This is the stupid simple plugin for [brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) code editor which adds uber-usable reverse functionality.

# Installation
You can just copy it to your bracket [extension
folder](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-Location)

# Usage
Select some text (or don't) and right-click. The last option should be sth like
reverse. Cheers.
